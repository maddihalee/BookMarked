# The Problem
People who read need a way to keep track of what books they are reading or want to read; they also need a place to leave reviews on books they've read so that they can remember what their thoughts on any given book were. 

## Tech Stack
- JavaScript / React
- Google Books API

## How to use BookMarked
The Home Page is simply a blank page with a search bar. Use this search bar to enter in any book title or author that you'd like to find and an array of books related to that search will appear on the page. 

The books are clickable and lead to a description page that tells the user what the book is about. Below that, there is a space for the user to add reviews. Users can see each other's reviews, but can only edit their own. 

This also has a "TBR" switch that the user can click to add any book to their To Be Read list. Switching a book to "TBR" will take the user to their TBR Page, which is just a list of all of the books that user has added to the TBR Page.

## Summarized Features
- Search bar allows for searching of books by title or by author
- Books may be added to the "To Be Read" page using the "TBR" switch
- Reviews can be left underneath any book by any user
